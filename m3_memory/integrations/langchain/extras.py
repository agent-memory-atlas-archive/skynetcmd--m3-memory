"""m3-native extras — the differentiators mem0/LangMem can't do (§0b).

A pure mem0 ``.add()``/``.search()`` shadow HIDES everything that makes m3 worth
switching to. This mixin adds first-class, typed methods for the five unmet
needs — contradiction handling, temporal reasoning, commanded forgetting,
hybrid+graph retrieval, and true extraction — over the SAME canonical dispatch,
so they can't drift from the mem0-compat surface.

These are **m3-native** (typed, discoverable methods we build), NOT the raw
``.call()`` **m3-passthru** escape hatch (§8 terminology). They never change the
mem0-compat signatures — a mem0 migrant's code stays byte-identical; the extras
are additive method names.

The mixin assumes the host class provides ``self._client`` (an ``M3Client``) and
``self._require_user`` (tenancy enforcement, §7).
